					<h3>What is this?</h3>
					<p>
						God Hates Charades is a game where players act out vile scenes in the form of <b>thirty seconds act outs.</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						Players receive points when a guesser <b>guesses their scene</b>. And guessers receive points for <b>guessing</b>.
					</p>
					<p>
						The first player to <b>seven points</b> wins.
					</p>
					<h3>What do I do when its my turn?</h3>
					<p>
						When it’s your turn you will be presented with two scenes. A scene is made up of two types of cards called an
						<b>Actor</b> and <b>Scenario</b>. You will have fifteen seconds to pick your scene. Once you choose a scene you
						will have thirty seconds to get the other players to guess your scene by acting it out. You may use speak, yell,
						shout, or do whatever it takes to get people to guess the scene.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6 col-md-6">
					<h4>What are the rules on acting?</h4>
					<p>
						As the Acting  player you can talk during your act out. This is not charades, because charades is lame and god hates
						it. You can also play multiple characters in the scene. Sometimes it’s necessary to construct an elaborate play
						in order to get Guessers to understand tthe scene.
					</p>
					<p>
						What you can’t do is say any of the words printed on either the character or scenario card. We also encourage you to
						act. It’s not very much fun if you just intellectualize the game into a weird fucked up version of million dollar pyramid.
					</p>
					<p>The Acting player also gets to decide if the Guessing player is close enough to get points. We call this the “jist” rule.
						More experienced players can be more strict as they learn the style of the game. If someone guesses your scene you get
						a point! Hurrah!
					</p>
					<h4>What are the rules on guessing?</h4>
					<p>
						As the Guessing player you have two rule. Guess the scene and get a point. You must guess in the character scenario format.
					</p>
					<p>
						A correct guess format would be:
						<i>God gets fired from his job.</i>
						<i>God gets fired.</i>
						<i>God is fired.</i>
					</p>
					<p>
						As an example a bad guess would be: 
						<i>Fired God</i>
						<i>God Fired</i>
						or by guessing God and then waiting five minutes and shouting <i>Oh! He’s getting fired!</i>
					</p>
